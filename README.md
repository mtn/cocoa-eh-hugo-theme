**Cocoa Enhanced** is a clean and responsive [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) [theme](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes/) with cool typography. The main goal of this theme is to be simple but highly customizable.

You can use this theme either for your blog or your personal website. A demo is available [here](https://kodewolf.com).

> This is a fork from the original [Cocoa](https://www.github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme) theme, with some improvements.
